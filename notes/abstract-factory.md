### Factory vs Abstract Factory

* In short, both factory patterns act work like Constructor. 
* Factory defines which properties of a class to set while Abstract Factory defines which class to instantiate. 
* Factory uses a static method of **a factory class** while Abstract Factory uses **a function**, a.k.a. Abstract Factory.  
* [Factory](../src/creational/factory.js) vs [Abstract-factory](../src/creational/abstract-factory.js)
